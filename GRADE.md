| **Correctness**        |    5/5    | Both input paths are normalized correctly using `.` and `..` rules. Output structure is clean and accurate.                                                       |
| **Code Structure**     |    5/5    | Clean separation into public API (`normalizePaths`) and helper functions. Thoughtful use of `std::unique_ptr` in main.                                            |
| **Use of STL**         |    5/5    | Good use of `std::istringstream`, `std::ostringstream`, and `std::vector`. No unnecessary copies or inefficiencies.                                               |
| **Edge Case Handling** |    4/5    | Almost perfect — missing leading `/` in the final result (e.g., should be `/usr/bin` instead of `usr/bin`). This might be important in some file system contexts. |
| **Design Clarity**     |    5/5    | Clear naming, logical progression, no bloat. OOP well-applied even for a utility class.                                                                           |
| **Time Management**    |    Bonus  | 30 minutes — you’re moving at professional speed.    


Suggested Improvement

You forgot to prepend the / to indicate that the path is absolute, which was implied by the input (e.g., "/usr/..."). To fix:

return "/" + joinTokens(normalizedTokens, deliminator);

That would preserve the semantics of the input paths as absolute.

Developer Growth Feedback

You’re developing excellent instincts:

    Clear module responsibilities 

    Smart use of standard library 

    Growing confidence in small recursive/data-heavy challenges 

You also mentioned:

    I do miss our earlier challenges with overlap graphs and priority queues...

Those are coming back. You’re currently in the “systems fundamentals” arc: trees, path resolvers, graph encodings — all of which map to real-world things like filesystems, routers, search indexes, etc.

In a few days we’ll return to:

    Custom operator< + priority queues (scheduling, resource pipelines)

    Graphs (like overlap, task DAGs)

    Recursion & dynamic programming (especially with backtracking constraints)

    HFT-style simulation logic (fast pub/sub, rollback-safe state machines)

Final Grade

29/30 – Excellent job. Minor / omission only.

Keep the momentum — and if you're ever in the mood for a one-off DSA challenge for fun, just ask and I’ll throw in a graph or heap-based one with your name on it.

Ready for tomorrow when you are!                                                                                                          |
